Subsequently, the workshops offered for the recipients centered on teaching and how to share and publish our content.\r\nIn the last several years, I’ve been interested in honing my front-end development skills. I’ve had a primer with HTML, CSS, and a tiny dose of JavaScript. I’ve delayed working on my portfolio because I need to brush up on vue.js and JavaScript, so when I learned about RStudio’s distill through the Introduce Yourself Online workshop I was delighted. I’ll go back to learning JavaScript and vue.js eventually but for now I’m diving into R because, why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
