I started building this website as part of an exercise in a workshop offered to recipients of RStudio’s 2021 Diversity Scholarship.\r\nIn the last several years, I’ve been interested in honing my front-end development skills. I’ve had a primer with HTML, CSS, and a tiny dose of JavaScript. I’ve been meaning to create a site for my portolio but I’ve consistently delayed working on it because I needed to brush up on vue.js and JavaScript. When I learned about RStudio’s distill through the Introduce Yourself Online workshop I was delighted.\r\nI’ll go back to learning JavaScript and vue.js eventually but for now, moaR R!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
