After wrapping up the course on ggplot2 in January 2021, I quickly switched gears to prepare for a two-part session on shiny for PSRC's virtual [R Learning Series](https://psrc.github.io/r-basics-I/).

The two-part series totaled a little over 3 hours. Topics ranged from how to get started to building the UI, creating the server logic, styling with packages (`shinythemes`, `bslib`) and CSS, and deployment.

The course website was created using distill and slides were created with `xaringan` and `xaringanextra`.
