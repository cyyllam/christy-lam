Hello World! Welcome to my very first `distill` site (yes, this site that you're browsing through!). I started building this website as part of an exercise in a workshop offered to recipients of [RStudio's 2021 Diversity Scholarship](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/11/30/diversity-scholarships/).  

In the last several years, I've been interested in honing my front-end development skills. I've had a primer with HTML, CSS, and a tiny dose of JavaScript. I've been meaning to create a site for my portolio but I've consistently delayed working on it because I needed to brush up on vue.js and JavaScript. When I learned about RStudio's `distill` through the *Introduce Yourself Online* workshop I was delighted. 

I'll go back to learning JavaScript and vue.js eventually but for now, moaR R!
