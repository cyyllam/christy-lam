# Hi there!

***

I am a data programmer and analyst living in Seattle. 
I work with the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) as part of their data science team working on general automation projects, dashboard building, and promoting R. When not dabbling in code, I'm catching up on the latest K-drama and improving my chocolate chip cookie baking skills.
